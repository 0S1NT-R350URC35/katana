# Katana Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the various pieces of Katana. Unlike normal Python unit tests, these tests
specifically test Katana units and ensure they evaluate a target correctly and find the flag. Most units require
specific test case files which can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uwh2xipvoaw31l2/AADb0j_U5ZobTRXCr-sJRCUra?dl=0).
