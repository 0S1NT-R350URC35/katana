Contributing
============

If you have not contributed to a project before, don't fret! GitHub has an
[awesome guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for helping 
support open-source projects. Basically the steps are:

1. [Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)
2. [Clone your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone)
3. [Make and push your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)
4. [Make a Pull Request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)
5. [And you're done!](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#huzzah)

Tabs vs. Spaces
---------------

We are a tabs family. Please ensure your editors insert actual tab characters
and not spaces. We will deny your pull requests.

Documentation
-------------

If you do add code to Katana, __we require documentation.__ We use simple 
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) to produce some
helpful ReadTheDocs pages. Please use [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google) in your code, and generally things will
look good!

Testing
--------

Admittedly we do not have formal unit tests for Katana. We **strongly** 
encourage you to test any code that you produce with some CTF challenges.

Once you are ready to do a pull-request, you should figure out if your changes
constitutes a new feature or a bugfix in stable or beta. If it is a bugfix in
stable or beta, you should do the pull-request against the branch in question,
and otherwise your pull-request should be against the dev branch.

Thank You!
----------

Lastly, _thank you_. This project has been a labor of love, and too often we 
simply do not have the time to continue to maintain and add to the project. 
We are grateful for everything little thing you do, from correcting our 
accidentals typos to adding new units and functionality.
