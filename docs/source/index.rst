Katana
==================================

``katana`` is a command-line utility that automates checking the "low-hanging fruit" in a CTF challenge. Written in Python, it is intended to help an individual do things they might otherwise forget to do.

A lot of the context and ideas for this tool come from the living document available at https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana
