:mod:`katana.units.esoteric` --- Esoteric Languages
=========================================================

These units evaluate code that seems to be from a given esoteric language.

.. note::

	Often times, these units can take a long amount of time and bottleneck Katana's operations. If you know you do not need these checks, include ``--exclude esoteric`` in your command.
