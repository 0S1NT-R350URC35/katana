This repository attempts to offer code and material to automate "running through the check-list" or hitting the "low-hanging fruit" in a Capture the Flag challenge. It is meant to act as a utility to help an individual _do things they might __otherwise forget to do__._

A lot of the context and ideas from this stem from the living document at [https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana)
